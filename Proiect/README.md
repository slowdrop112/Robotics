<h1 align = "center" > Gas Detector </h1>

<p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
So basically, this system determines whether the sensor detects gas or not :).
It works like all the other gas detectors. If gas is not detected, the system is in the "initial" mode, and by initial mode, I mean that the LED is turned off, and the buzzer doesn't make any sound.
But when gas is detected, the buzzer starts making noise, and the LED starts flickering a red light, something like a warning alarm, and at the same time, on the LCD it is showed a warning message.

<p> </p> 
The idea of making a Gas Detector actually came when I was lighting up some coal blocks, and the gas detector started going crazy. And after that, I thought, it is something kind of easy to do, but it's a must-have in everyone's kitchen. 

<p> </p> 
I really think that this system is very useful, a lifesaver I could say, because most of the time, you can't detect all the gas leaks, and if not detected, everyone could blow up :/

## Hardware description

### 1. Microcontroller: ATmega328P
* Digital Pin: For LED control, buzzer, and LCD
* Analog Pin: For MQ7 Sensor
* Frequence: 16 MHz
* Power: 5V through USB
  
### 2. Sensor: MQ7
* Type: Analog
* Pin: analog A0
* Power: 5V
* Functionality: Sends an analogic value that's like the detected temperature

### 3.LED
* Pin: digital 6
* Functionality: It indicates whether the system detects gas or not
* Consumption: ~20 mA.

### 4. Buzzer
* Pin : digital 7
* Functionality: It emits a sound for alerts when it detects gas
* Consumption: ~30 mA.


### 5. LCD 16X2
* Type: Character Display
* Pins: 2,3,4,5,11,12
* Functionality: It displays the system data
* Consumption: ~50-100 mA.

### Overall Functionality
So the MQ7 sensor sends analog data to the A0 pin of the Arduino Uno. Then, the LCD displays a message like " !WARNING! GAS DETECTED", and the buzzer and the LED are activated too.

### Overall Consumption
* LED: ~20 mA
* BUZZER: ~30 mA
* LCD: ~20-100 mA
* MQ7 GAS SENSOR: <5mA
* TOTAL:  ~150-200 mA

<h2>Software Design</h2>
So the Software Design is very practical and easy to understand. First of all we have got the libraries Wire.h and LiquidCrystal.h. 
<h2>The Wire.h library </h2>
is used to communicate with the Inter-integrated Circuit, and it facilitates communication between the Arduino and peripherals connected, like sensors or displays.
