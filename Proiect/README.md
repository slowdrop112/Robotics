<h1 align = "center" > Gas Detector </h1>

<p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
So basically, this system determines whether the sensor detects gas or not :). 
It works like all the other gas detectors, if gas is not detected, the system is in the "initial" mode, and by initial mode I mean that the LED is turned off, and the buzzer doesn't make any sound.
But when gas is detected, the buzzer starts making noise, and the LED starts flickering a red light, something like a warning alarm.

The ideea of making a Gas Detector actually came when I was lightig up some coal blocks and the gas detector started going crazy. And after that I tought, it is something kind of easy to do, but it's a must be in everyone's kitchen.

I really think that this system is very useful, almost a lifesaver, because in most of the times, you can't detect all the gas leaks, and if not detected everyone could blow up :/
